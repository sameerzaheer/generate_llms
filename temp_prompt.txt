I will give you an llms.txt file containing this structure:

# Title

> Optional description goes here

Optional details go here

## Section name

- [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details

## Optional

- [Link title](https://link_url)


I want you to make it better by:

- have meaningful "Section name"

- re-arranging the sections 

- putting all the miscellaneous items into a section called "## Optional"


In addition, the website owner wants you to make this llms.txt so that it emphasizes: "Emphasize our product offerings more than careers".
